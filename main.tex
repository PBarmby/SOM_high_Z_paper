\begin{abstract}%% (Must be 250 Words)
Spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy contains information about the physical properties of it.
Classifying SEDs using temples helps understand the nature of the source of SEDs.
However, available SED templates are limited, which makes finding type of SEDs tricky.
Most of the current classifying methods cannot classify SEDs outside the ones in the template, and will fail in the special cases.
In this paper, we introduced a new method of clustering high red-shift galaxies, based on their spectral energy distributions (SED)s.
SOM is a type of the artificial neural networks, which mostly is used to identify subgroups in a sample.
We utilized an unsupervised self-organizing map (SOM) as a method to train networks using templates of SEDs ranging from far ultraviolet (FUV) to near infrared (NIR) wavelengths.
Then, we used the trained networks to cluster a sample of 142 galaxies with 0.5 < $z$ < 1.
Since, some the SEDs of these galaxies are not exactly the same as the ones in the template, the previous attempts to classifying SEDs of this group of galaxies were not completely successful. 
By using SOM, we classify those special SEDs and show that they have similarities to two more of the template ones.
We investigated the vapidity of our results, by studying the SEDs, and some physical properties of the galaxies that are averaged over galaxies in each neuron the SOMs.

\section{SUMMARY AND FUTURE APPLICATIONS}
\label{sec: summary}

% Self organizing maps can be used to classify celestial objects (i.e. stars, quasars, spectra of galaxies, light curves, etc.).
% We showed that we can create various networks with different sizes/dimensions based on information we need from the data. 
% If a broad and general classification is required, networks can have one dimension with few number of neurons.
% While if we need classifications based on differences in more details, we can use a higher number of neurons.
% Since the SOM codes does not work with uncertainty of input parameter, sometimes too much attention to details can cause problems in classifications. 
% Some small differences could easily be the result of atmosphere fluctuation or other instrumental or observational problems. 
% for using SOM method, one should be careful about these small differences and consider in order to separate two groups from each other, how much details do they need to pay attention to.

% We used SOMs to classify SEDs of the galaxies with known morphological type from K96, and created networks with different usages.
% By varying size of networks, we found the relative similarity or dissimilarity between each type of galaxies.
% since we needed a 1D network with 22 neurons to be able to separate all the 12 types of galaxies from K96 for the first time, we concluded that types B and E, and types SB1 and SB2 galaxies are really similar to each other.
% We also showed that networks generated with SOM method can be used to easily identified new type of the galaxies or outlier, in large surveys.

% The sample of 142 high red-shift galaxies from T12 was used to test the trained networks.
% One of the main criteria to chose a test sample is that the test sample must have fluxes in exactly the same wavelengths of the training sample.
% The test results showed that using SOMs can lead us to identify galaxies with SEDs similar to two or more morphological types but not exactly the same as one of them.
% A freedom of having in between types is one of the main differences between supervised and unsupervised ANNs.
% T12  have used a supervised training method, and trained networks with K96 SED template.
% Same as this project, they tried to classify the sample of 142 galaxies using the trained networks.
% However, they could not classify 37 out of 142 galaxies in the sample.
% The unsupervised method that we used in this project, gave us the ability to classify galaxies either as one of the morphological types that have been introduced by K96 or between those types. 
% Therefore, we classified all 142 galaxies of our test sample.
% We plotted the properties of the galaxies in test sample using new classification and found a tighter correlations between mean values of age, sSFR, stellar mass, and extinction in FUV band of the galaxies in new classifications than previous studies.
% We also showed he properties of the galaxies in each groups is in good agreement between their morphological types.
